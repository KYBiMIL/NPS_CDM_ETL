 --Description: Create Person table
			   1) In sample cohort DB, person data are inserted as duplicated by years, which makes it possible to track the change of income quantiles, location and etc..
			    In CDM, however, person should be unique, so the latest person data would be converted
			   2) Assume and insert the birth year by using the 5-year age intervals
